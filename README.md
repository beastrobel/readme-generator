## README Generator

# Description

The challenge was to develop a README generator in Node.js. The application prompts the user in the terminal (index.js) for project title, description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests, and questions. When all of the information is collected, it displays a 'Success!' message. The generator creates a README.json file, which is imported into a separate module: format.js. When the user types node format.js into the terminal, then it displays a 'Success!' message, and generates a formatted README.md file. 

# Installation

Please install the Inquirer npm package to utilize the README Generator.
